# veil_of_ignorance

What rules would we make for a society if we did not know which member we would be?

This project seeks to build a virtual veil of ignorance. The veil of ignorance is a philosophical method to help decision-makers create fair decisions. This method asks decision-makers to choose rules for a society in advance, before they knew which position in society they held.
